     I decided to make my website about the renaissance which occured during the 15th and 16th centuries and symbolised the beginning of a new era of art and 
     would rebirth greek and roman periods. It started in italy and would reach england until the 16th century but would come to an end during the 17th century. The Medici Family would 
      be some of the few poeple to start this movement along with Francesco Petrarca. Some great artist, authors and scientist would become well known during this era. The reniassance 
      has been credited with cloing the gap between the middle ages and mordern civilization.
