     <h1>The renaissance</h1>
      
     <p>
      <h1 style="font-size:20px">I decided to make my website about the renaissance which occured during the 15th and 16th centuries and symbolised the beginning of a new era of art and 
     would rebirth greek and roman periods. It started in italy and would reach england until the 16th century but would come to an end during the 17th century.
